## IAM FLASHCARDS
lets start with IAM (Identity and Access Management) concepts.
**Flashcard 1:**
- **Front:** What is Identity and Access Management (IAM)?
- **Back:** IAM is a framework of policies and technologies that ensures the right individuals have access to the right resources at the right times for the right reasons.
**Flashcard 2:**
- **Front:** What are the main components of IAM?
- **Back:** The main components of IAM include Identity Management, Access Management, and Privileged Access Management.
**Flashcard 3:**
- **Front:** What is the principle of least privilege in IAM?
- **Back:** The principle of least privilege states that users should be granted the minimum levels of access – or permissions – needed to perform their job functions.
**Flashcard 4:**
- **Front:** What is Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)?
- **Back:** MFA is a security system that requires more than one method of authentication from independent categories of credentials to verify the user's identity.
**Flashcard 5:**
- **Front:** What is Single Sign-On (SSO)?
- **Back:** SSO is an authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications with one set of login credentials.
**Flashcard 6:**
- **Front:** What is Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)?
- **Back:** RBAC is a method of regulating access to computer or network resources based on the roles of individual users within an organization.
**Flashcard 7:**
- **Front:** What is the difference between authentication and authorization in IAM?
- **Back:** Authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity, while authorization is the process of granting or denying access to resources based on that identity.
**Flashcard 8:**
- **Front:** What is a digital identity in the context of IAM?
- **Back:** A digital identity is the online representation of an individual, organization, or device, consisting of attributes and credentials used for authentication and access control.
**Flashcard 9:**
- **Front:** What is Privileged Access Management (PAM)?
- **Back:** PAM is a subset of IAM that focuses on managing and monitoring access to critical
    systems and sensitive information by privileged users.
**Flashcard 10:**
- **Front:** Why is IAM important for organizational security?
- **Back:** IAM is crucial for protecting sensitive data, ensuring compliance with regulations, and reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
**Flashcard 11:**
- **Front:** What is an access control list (ACL)?
- **Back:** An ACL is a list of permissions attached to an object that specifies which users or system processes are granted access to that object and what operations they can perform.
**Flashcard 12:**
- **Front:** What is the difference between a user and a group in IAM?
- **Back:** A user is an individual identity with specific access rights, while a group is a collection of users that can be assigned shared access permissions.
**Flashcard 13:**
- **Front:** What is federation in IAM?
- **Back:** Federation is a process that allows users to access multiple systems or applications using a single set of credentials, often across different organizations.
**Flashcard 14:**
- **Front:** What is the role of policies in IAM?
- **Back:** Policies in IAM define the rules and conditions under which access to resources is granted or denied.
**Flashcard 15:**
- **Front:** What is the difference between identity management and access management?
- **Back:** Identity management focuses on creating, maintaining, and deleting user identities, while access management focuses on controlling access to resources based on those identities.
**Flashcard 16:**
- **Front:** What is a security token in IAM?
- **Back:** A security token is a physical or digital device that provides an additional layer of security by generating a one-time password or code for authentication.
**Flashcard 17:**
- **Front:** What is the concept of "just-in-time" access in IAM?
- **Back:** "Just-in-time" access is a security practice that grants users temporary access to resources only when needed, reducing the risk of prolonged access.
**Flashcard 18:**
- **Front:** What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous authentication?
- **Back:** Synchronous authentication requires real-time interaction between the user and the authentication system, while asynchronous authentication allows for delayed verification, such as through email or SMS codes.
**Flashcard 19:**
- **Front:** What is the purpose of audit logs in IAM?
- **Back:** Audit logs record user activities and access events, helping organizations monitor compliance, detect security incidents, and conduct investigations.
**Flashcard 20:**

- **Back:** "Zero trust" is a security model that assumes no user or device is trusted by default, requiring continuous verification of identity and access rights.
**Flashcard 21:**
- **Front:** What is the difference between a password and a passphrase in IAM?
- **Back:** A password is typically a short string of characters used for authentication, while a passphrase is a longer sequence of words or characters that provides enhanced security.
**Flashcard 22:**
- **Front:** What is the role of encryption in IAM?
- **Back:** Encryption protects sensitive data during transmission and storage, ensuring that only authorized users can access the information.
**Flashcard 23:**

- **Back:** IDaaS is a cloud-based service that provides identity and access management solutions to organizations without the need for on-premises infrastructure.
**Flashcard 43:**
- **Front:** What is the difference between authentication factors?
- **Back:** Authentication factors are categorized into three types: something you know (password), something you have (security token), and something you are (biometrics).
**Flashcard 44:**

- **Back:** Session management controls user sessions to ensure secure access, including session timeouts and termination after inactivity.
**Flashcard 45:**
- **Front:** What is the concept of "identity federation protocols"?
- **Back:** Identity federation protocols, such as SAML and OAuth, enable secure sharing of identity information between different systems or organizations.
**Flashcard 46:**
- **Front:** What is the role of access tokens in IAM?
